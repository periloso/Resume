I've found this kind of groups tend to constraint competition to productive levels and, using everyone's knowledge in parallel, makes using all the resources available possible.<br /><br /> Since 2010, during my free time, I've published many new projects under the <span><a class='reference' title='Alessio Periloso - Google Code Project Hosting' href='http://goo.gl/rreuR'>Google Code Project Hosting</a></span> and started many collaborations with other developers. Among them, a lightweight Validation Server written in Python (it uses SQLite or, optionally, MySQL) supporting both OATH/HOTP and Yubico Yubikey criptokeys. The <span>Yubico AB</span> added this server among the official ones in <a class='reference' title='Yubico added the yubiserve among their solutions' href='http://www.yubico.com/validation-server'>their own website</a>.<br /><br />I've been promoter of many open source projects; among them, in the 2003, the OpenC6 project which successfully led to the creation of a Linux client for the Italian famous <span>Telecom Italia</span> chatroom.<br /> Even if at first Telecom Italia didn't approve the project, I've been able to reverse engineer the program, the network protocol and the cryptography used. Then I've assembled enough developers to start the collaborative project. <a href='http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/C6_Messenger' class='reference' title='OpenC6 on Wikipedia'>The collaboration has been productive</a>, and our chat client <a class='reference' title='OpenC6 recognized by Telecom Italia' href='http://c6.community.alice.it/home/openc6.html'>has even been officially recognized by Telecom Italia itself</a>.<td>

Even if I try to be as much helpful as possible to every teammate, I do still recognize people who try to take advantage of my helpfulness and I react accordingly. This is the reason why I tend to represent a leader, somebody who has to be listened when having something to say, to both colleagues and friends, trying to always empathize with them before giving advice.<br /><br /> I worked in open source projects both as developer  and promoter at first, and then focused on the work made with <span>Akron Business Technologies</span>.<br /><br /> I can consider myself satisfied for the results obtained so far, because they increased both my experience (relational and skill-related) as well as my friendships.</td>
