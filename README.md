# Curricula Engine

Write and publish your resume easily with Curricula Engine and Github Pages!
Curricula Engine allow you to easily deploy your Curriculum Vitae / Resume within minutes: you just have to put all the content in the required directories, and the Curricula will be automagically generated for you.
It even supports multiple languages!

## Usage
The engine has been created to allow you to easily deploy a successful resume.

### Directories
The content must be placed in the appropriated directories:
- _current_positions contains the jobs you are working on right now.
- _data contains your personal informations and the translations.
- _education contains your education
- _includes contains the html template that will be assembled in the web page you'll publish. You're free to edit it to better suit your needs.
- _languages contains the languages you know
- _layouts contains the script that builds the html template. You can move the sections around or have fun with it if you want, but it's not required.
- _other_information contains the "other stuff" you'll see at the bottom (with the current template)
- _photo contains a photo, called "photo.png" that will be included within the curricula
- _previous_employments contains all your previous employments
- _skills contains your skills (eg.: organizational, relational, technical, artistic skills and your accomplishments)
- "en" and "it" are the directories required to build the page with different languages
- static contains the static content (css, js, fonts, images) required by the current template
