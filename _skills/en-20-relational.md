  "Relational skills"
description:
  "My key to success in relations with people is about using active listening. Creating new relations has usually been easier for me trying to make people feel comfortable at first and then making them feel I'm opening up: an authoritative rather than an authoritarian approach helped me many times when having to deal with new people. Even if I try to be as much helpful as possible to every teammate, I do still recognize people who try to take advantage of my helpfulness and I react accordingly. This is the reason why I tend to represent a leader, somebody who has to be listened when having something to say, to both colleagues and friends, trying to always empathize with them before giving advice.<br /><br /> I worked in open source projects both as developer  and promoter at first, and then focused on the work made with <span>Akron Business Technologies</span>.<br /><br /> I can consider myself satisfied for the results obtained so far, because they increased both my experience (relational and skill-related) as well as my friendships."
